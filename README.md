# AI Movie App ðŸŽ¬

This application is built following **Clean Architecture** principles, leveraging **Dependency Injection**, **Shared Preferences**, and **Cubit/BLoC** for state management.

The entire app is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, following a modular structure to separate concerns and ensure clean, testable code.

## Project Highlights âœ¨

- **Clean Architecture** for clear separation of layers and maintainable code.
- **Dependency Injection** to manage and inject dependencies easily.
- **Cubit/BLoC** state management for predictable and testable states.
- **Shared Preferences** for lightweight persistent data storage.
